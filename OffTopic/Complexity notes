P - Poly nomial time
NP - hard
Exponential time

What do engineers do,
Input: Specifications x
We want a design - the nice picture
Once we have y  we can check that whether y is a good specification (satisfys x)
c of xy is true
Obviously building can't go on too long so the design can't be too complex.
length of y should be limited by some polynomial of the length of x.

Once we have an answer checking is easy. what is difficult is coming up with the answer.
