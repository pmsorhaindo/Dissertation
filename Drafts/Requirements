Discussion of my problem (Ant Colony) and other elements involved in creating the artifact.

What behaviour is the project's resulting artifact aiming to exhibit.

Ants seek out food randomly, when food is found Ants return to the colony leaving a trail of pheremone. Other ants can then pick up on this trail to more efficiently find food.
