	meaning of this intelligence is analyzed in the paper. We define
	robot intelligence and robot system intelligence in terms of unpredictability
	of improbable behavior. The concept of unpredictability is analyzed
	in relation to (1) statistical unpredictability, (2) inaccessibility,
	(3) undecidability, (4) intractability, and (5) non-representability.
	We argue that the latter two type of unpredictability, when exhibited
	by systems capable of producing order, can result in a non-trivial,
	different form of intelligent behavior (Swarm Intelligence). Engineering
	problems related to Swarm Intelligence are mentioned in relation
	to Cellular Robotic Systems which consist of collections of autonomous,
	non-synchronized, non-intelligent robots cooperating to achieve global
	tasks.},

  month = jan,
  abstract = {{Written by an expert in the game industry, Christer Ericson's new
	book is a comprehensive guide to the components of efficient real-time
	collision detection systems. The book provides the tools and know-how
	needed to implement industrial-strength collision detection for the
	highly detailed dynamic environments of applications such as 3D games,
	virtual reality applications, and physical simulators.
	
	
	Of the many topics covered, a key focus is on spatial and object partitioning
	through a wide variety of grids, trees, and sorting methods. The
	author also presents a large collection of intersection and distance
	tests for both simple and complex geometric shapes. Sections on vector
	and matrix algebra provide the background for advanced topics such
	as Voronoi regions, Minkowski sums, and linear and quadratic programming.
	
	
	Of utmost importance to programmers but rarely discussed in this much
	detail in other books are the chapters covering numerical and geometric
	robustness, both essential topics for collision detection systems.
	Also unique are the chapters discussing how graphics hardware can
	assist in collision detection computations and on advanced optimization
	for modern computer architectures. All in all, this comprehensive
	book will become the industry standard for years to come.
	
	
	*Presents algorithms and data structures with wide applications to
	the fields of game development, virtual reality, physically based
	simulation, CAD/CAM, architectural and scientific visualization,
	molecular modeling, engineering simulation, GIS, ray tracing, and
	more.
	
	*Describes tested, real-world methods, liberally illustrated by C
	\& C++ code.
	
	*Reviews necessary concepts from mathematics and computational geometry,
	and includes extensive references to other sources and research literature.}},

	The process of writing large parallel programs is complicated by the
	need to specify both the parallel behaviour of the program and the
	algorithm that is to be used to compute its result. This paper introduces
	evaluation strategies, lazy higher-order functions that control the
	parallel evaluation of non-strict functional languages. Using evaluation
	strategies, it is possible to achieve a clean separation between
	algorithmic and behavioural code. The result is enhanced clarity
	and shorter parallel programs.
	
	
	Evaluation strategies are a very general concept: this paper shows
	how they can be used to model a wide range of commonly used programming
	paradigms, including divide-and-conquer, pipeline parallelism, producer/consumer
	parallelism, and data-oriented parallelism. Because they are based
	on unrestricted higher-order functions, they can also capture irregular
	parallel structures. Evaluation strategies are not just of theoretical
	interest: they have evolved out of our experience in parallelising
	several large-scale parallel applications, where they have proved
	invaluable in helping to manage the complexities of parallel behaviour.
	Some of these applications are described in detail here. The largest
	application we have studied to date, Lolita, is a 60,000 line natural
	language engineering system. Initial results show that for these
	programs we can achieve acceptable parallel performance, for relatively
	little programming effort.},
