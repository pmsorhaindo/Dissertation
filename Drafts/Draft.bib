	in relation to (1) statistical unpredictability, (2) inaccessibility,

	We argue that the latter two type of unpredictability, when exhibited
	by systems capable of producing order, can result in a non-trivial,
	different form of intelligent behavior (Swarm Intelligence). Engineering
	problems related to Swarm Intelligence are mentioned in relation
	to Cellular Robotic Systems which consist of collections of autonomous,

	The process of writing large parallel programs is complicated by the
	need to specify both the parallel behaviour of the program and the
	algorithm that is to be used to compute its result. This paper introduces
	evaluation strategies, lazy higher-order functions that control the
	parallel evaluation of non-strict functional languages. Using evaluation
	strategies, it is possible to achieve a clean separation between
	algorithmic and behavioural code. The result is enhanced clarity
	and shorter parallel programs.
	
	
	Evaluation strategies are a very general concept: this paper shows
	how they can be used to model a wide range of commonly used programming
	paradigms, including divide-and-conquer, pipeline parallelism, producer/consumer
	parallelism, and data-oriented parallelism. Because they are based
	on unrestricted higher-order functions, they can also capture irregular
	parallel structures. Evaluation strategies are not just of theoretical
	interest: they have evolved out of our experience in parallelising
	several large-scale parallel applications, where they have proved
	invaluable in helping to manage the complexities of parallel behaviour.
	Some of these applications are described in detail here. The largest
	application we have studied to date, Lolita, is a 60,000 line natural
	language engineering system. Initial results show that for these
	programs we can achieve acceptable parallel performance, for relatively
	little programming effort.},
