\paragraph{}Listed here are the aforementioned generalizations or preconceptions about ants and their colonies, that will be assumed as factual for the purposes of this project. All ants need both food and water to survive, according to the Center for Insect Science Education Outreach at the University of Arizona ants can go for quite some time without food but without water they will be dead within a day. For this reason water will be a stronger priority for all ants over food and ants within the simulation will die without water or food, I will determine the amount of time a satiated ant can survive for as three simulation days without food and six simulation hours without water. After reading an article on the BBC News website about sleeping patterns in ants I learnt that that queen ants live for years where as worker ants live for months because of this statement I'm giving queen ants within my simulation a lifespan of three to four simulation years and likewise worker ants will have a life span of three to four simulation months. The same article went on to talk about how ants sleep in short power naps lasting just over a minute two hundred and fifty times a day and the queen sleeps for longer periods of around six minutes nintey times a day, I also will reflect this in the context of my simulation. The concept of insects having different roles or jobs within a hive is explored in the work of Oster and Wilson (1978) (!cite) although I won't get into too much detail on this point I will outline different roles that ants within the simulation can take. Firstly there is a queen, in my simulation this will be dramatically simplified to one per colony, her job will to simply lay eggs to produce more workers.

\paragraph{}In the simulation the queen will be allowed to produce eggs at varying frequency depending on how much food and water is available to her and she will only produce offsring while there is room in the nest. Her main priority will be ensuring the colony doesn't run out of workers. Rhe 'worker' class of ants will then be subdivided into four seperate castes. Firstly a builder caste of ant will be created who's main priority is to build, maintain and repair the colony's nest. A builder ant's work will never be done as even when the nest is in excellent condition the ants will always strive to make the nest bigger so the queen can continue producing ants and for increased space for food storage. Builder caste ants will also be responsible for cleaning the nest. The second class of ants to exist within the simulation will be be the gatherers this castes' number one priority is to go out to known sources of food and water and carry it back to the colony's nest for storage. Slightly different from this class is the scout whose main purpose is to explore new territory and communicate to other ants where new sources of food and water are aswell as building materials useful for the builder caste of ant. Finally onr last caste will be outlined as the soldier ants whose main job is to protect the the nest and provide security, they will attempt to achieve this by patrolling the perimiter of the nest, the perimiter of the ant colony's territory as defined by the scout caste, and other important areas to the colony such as the food store and the queen.

\paragraph{}Within my artifact I'll have to represent each of these castes by varying values of attributes assigned to each ant. I will go into further detail about the attributes I will use to represent ants within my system in further detail later. But I will also have to represent communication between the ants, to keep communication between ants to some level of realism I will allow each ant within the simulation to produce pheremones. Pheremones will vary in strength  All ants will have the capability to release a pheremone indicating danger. When ants die they will release a very strong pheremone signaling general danger, but scout ants will be able to release strong pheremones indicating whether this is a danger all ants should flee from or if soldier ants should move in and either protect the nest. Situations will often occur where scout ants will call in the aid of soldier ants to attack a larger insect and once this attack is successful the target is now a food source. Scout ants will notify gatherer ants of this by again releasing a pheremone which indicates a food source has been discovered while returning to the nest. I will also allow builder ants to communicate with a similar system detecting scout pheremones indicating building resources or an area of damaged nest and react accordingly. Scout ants will be able to release most pheremones that all castes of ant are capable of producing while other castes range of pheremones will be more specialized. Details of of the planned pheremone structure will be shown in the table below (Table fig.~\ref{tab:foo})
