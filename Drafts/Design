Design

Types
The types that will be involved in modeling the simulation of an Ant colony are as follows.

Ant          :: Ant
Pheremone    :: Double
Food         :: Double
Nest         :: Bool
AntQuadrant  :: Graph -> Holds- Possible Ant
PherQuadrant :: Graph -> Holds- Pheremone Level
FoodQuadrant :: Graph -> Holds- Possible Food
NestQuadrant :: Graph -> Holds- Possible NestArea
AntWorld     :: Graph -> Holds- Many Ant Quadrants
PherWorld    :: Graph -> Holds- Many PherQuadrants
FoodWorld    :: Graph -> Holds- Many FoodQuadrants
NestWorld    :: Graph -> Holds- Many NestQuadrants

Key Functions
The functions responsible for the flow of the program are

stitchUpAntQuads - Sequentially processes pairs of edge-nodes on a Graph (to possibly move Ants between AntQuadrants).
stitchUpPherQuads - Sequentially processes pairs of edge-nodes on a Graph (to manage the spread of Phermone between PherQuadrants).

processAntQuadrant - Moves each Ant within a quadrant.
processPherQuadrant - Evaporates the Pheremone 


Main
Given Starting parameters create a World.
-Parameters
Size of Quadrant :: Int
Size of World :: Int
Amount of Ants :: Int
Amount of Food :: Int

-Initialize random nest area proportional to the amount of Ants.
-Randomly position Ants around the Nest Area
-Randomly position Food (not In Food Area)
-Initialize all PherQuadrants as 0 except for Food Quadrants which maintain 10.0

Loop
